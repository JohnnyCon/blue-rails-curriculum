**ERB explanation**

ERB is a templating system that allows you to mix HTML and Ruby together.  It is
the default templating system that ships with Rails.  You can switch Erb to
Haml, Liquid and a host of other templating systems. 

Code contained within <% %> brackets will be interpreted by ruby on the server
side. This is typically where you'll put your if, else, and end statements. 

Code contained within <%= %> brackets will be interpreted by ruby on the server
and also output the result of running that expression.
